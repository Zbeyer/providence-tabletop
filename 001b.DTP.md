# Down Time Points (D.T.P.)

> Down Time Points were the first of many new "currencies"

Down Time Points (DTP) is a currency reward that can be traded between players. It functionally can be redeemed for 1 hour of down time activity. It can be exchanged with NPC's for special rewards.

* DTP can be redeemed between sessions or during session periods of low action. 
* 1 DTP is equal to 1 hour of in-game time, but doesn't affect time of day.
    * 8 DTP is equal to a working day—a full day dedicated to an action like studying spell research or working a day trade.

Before a player took off a game month to do something that amounted to the roll of one die. Then they waited for other players to fill in the gap. Today they spend the hoarded DTP which equates to a working calendar month (240) while other players hoard DTP or spend fast depending on their needs. Flow is no longer dependent on syncing calendars—players decide the pace of the story independent of personal projects.  



## Downtime Activity Examples

###  Advance Understanding: Lore Points (LP)

>   Lore Scribing & Private Investigation: Lore / Leverage Points (LP)

Lore Scribing is time spent in a library researching about creatures or otherworldly entities. Lore Points (LP) act as a permanent modifier on a specific monster / creature researched. Researching a specific monster entry (Imp, Star Spawn Gru, Adult Green Dragons, Basilisk, Goblin, Owl Bear etc.) consumes DTP based on its challenge rating (minimum of 1). Goblins are easy to research. An ancient Green Dragon is considerably harder to research. 

*   A single Lore Point acts as a permanent +1 modifier to any skill check related to its subject matter
    *   2 Lore points on Goblins means rolling stealth, slight of hand, grapple (athletics), deception, etc. against a goblin is modified by +2 in the researcher's favor.
*   Each additonal point of lore costs DTP equal to the challenge rating multiplied by the level of lore 
    *   An Owl Bear (Challenge Rating 3) costs 3 DTP for the first Lore Point: (+1 on skill checks)
    *   An Owl Bear (Challenge Rating 3) costs an additional 6 DTP to upgrade to the second lore point (+2 on skill checks): 2 * 3. 
    *   That means to go from zero LP on Owl Bear to 2 LP on Owl Bear a total of 9 (3 + 6) hours / DTP is spent researching Owl Bears.

Characters may also researched named entities such as characters, warlock patrons, or deities. These named characters likewise cost 1 DTP per challenge rating multiplied by the lore point being unlocked. Tiamat costs 30 DTP for a +1 skill check modifier and an additional 60 DTP (90 DTP total) for a +2.

>   Private Investigation to accumulate Leverage is thematically different from Lore Scribing but the costs and boon associated is the same.



### [Building a Stronghold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#BuildingaStronghold)

Rules for this are already in the DM's guide for DnD and the Harn books. Time cost converted to DTP at a rate of 8 per day. Construction costs are construction costs.



### [Business / Trade Operations](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#RunningaBusiness)

>   See also [xgte Work](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#Work)

**Business and Trade Operations** are something very heavily outlined in HARN and loosely outlined in DnD. This means time spent applying a trade or buisness unrelated to the adventure—usuallly as a way to make money. 

Trades are easy enough to manage: how much time do you spend working the forge / mill / loom / etc., what costs are incurred, kind of money do you earn at the end of the time. Do you meet anyone interesting?

>    Establishing and running a business, especially one with employees who work while you are away, is a lot like training a mount from infancy to adulthood. It has its own attributes and potential for in-game events down the line. It can provide you with contacts, income, and other events. You need to spend time and money growing it, check up on it often, and eventually it becomes a mighty weapon.... or just buy one out for an appropriate sum of coin.



### Campaigning

**Campaigning** is down time spent to boost your own influence or the influence of a contact. Campaigning pertains to an office, such as trying to gather support for a Shek P’var (HARN mages) to be promoted, or a candidate to be elected to  the Freeport senate, or a Lord’s claim to be forwarded in right of succession. Campaigning differs dramatically from Lobbying in that instead of targeting a single entity to be affected you are attempting to get mass support on behalf of a single entitity.

Instead of creating an LP, campaigning creates an Influence Point (IP) for the chosen entity. Influence doesn't last for ever. Once it is spent it is gone. So Influence points must be redeemed on a skill check against a mass of entities. The cost of the influence depends on the challenge rating of the campaign itself and hte influence pertains to a single check or outcome against that campaign. 

Because Influence points are not permanent boons they always cost the same DTP for each point...

*   A campaign to elect the mayor of Phandalin might be a CR 8, so each influence point would cost a flat 8 DTP and then points might be spent during a debate to sway the town.
*   A campaign to promote journyman mage to master might be more of a CR 25 and influence might have to be spent on each magic chantry attempted to be swayed as the potition circulates. 

>   Appropriate contacts can be paid to perform most downtime activities for you (excluding spell research and spell practice).



### [Carousing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#Carousing)

>   I like to use DnD Xgte & Dm's guide as a leaping off point for what *might* be...

Carousing, more generally, is going to be time spent socially with a specific establishment for entertainment with the chance to acquire contacts, notoriety, reputation, or other events related to that business. In this case DTP is accompanied by the spending of currency and the results may be randomly generated or dictated or a choose your adventure set of choices. 

>   While the word implies drinking and being lively—I let the players use the rules as a template but apply their own fluff (see [DM's guide for Carousing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#Carousing)). If the noble Ranger's idea of a good social time is more reserved but includes approaching strangers—let them add a little flavor and spin any events off that.

This is more than just going to ask for rumors or buy something, this is the guy who hangs out at the game shop for five hours buying snacks and talking to the other patrons. This is the lush who blows his paycheck on a week worth of drunken relvary. This is the enthusiast who really wants to make connections with a local artisian guild. 



### [Crafting a Magic Item](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#CraftingaMagicItem)

>   [xgte changes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#CraftinganItem)

Rules for this are already in the DM's guide for DnD and the Harn books. Time cost converted to DTP at a rate of 8 per day. Construction costs are construction costs. Harn artifact forging has its own set of rules. Artifact forging consumes DTP based on the time cost in whatever rule system at work (DnD has rules, HARN has additional rules). Convert days to hours at a rate of 8 hours a day of productive time and move forward as normal. This paragraph is spagetti and I'll clean it up later.



### [Crime](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#Crime)

Good set of rules for DnD. DTP penalty for jail time.



### [Gaining Renown (Reputation in Organization)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#GainingRenown)

Rules for this are already in the DM's guide for DnD. Time cost converted to DTP at a rate of 8 per day.



### [Gambling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#Gambling)

Good set of rules for DnD. Conversion should be obvious at this point.



### Land Surveying

Land surveying is downtime spent both on the road and in the library to determine the strategic, resource, or archeological resources of a given region. **Land Points** (Also LP) are accrued in this task. CR of a region same as any other LP. Skill checks related to the land or better using the land would then get modifiers by region / land LP. 



### Lobbying

Lobbying is the same as lore scribing but applied to a faction as opposed is time spent openly persuading an organization to support you or your cause. DTP costs will be based on the challenge rating of the organization and their opinion of the character (heavily at DM's discretion). The reward is the same as LP but on a faction wide basis.

*   1 LP with the Freeport Merchant's guild equates to a +1 on skill checks made against members of the Merchant's guild.



###  Occult, Science & AlchemyDevelopment: TBD

Alchemy development is something that I tried but it started to get a bit broken. For now I'm leaving this here as an I need to develop further. It is related also to **mutation development** where alchemists and occultist style characters could modify their inboarn racial features along a very home brewed path—but finding a balance here has been difficult. So I'm not ready to commit to long term rules



### [Performing Sacred Rites](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#PerformingSacredRites)

>   see also [xgte religious service](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#ReligiousService)

Rules for this are already in the DM's guide for DnD and the Harn books. Time cost converted to DTP at a rate of 8 per day. Piety or favors earned depend on the rule system being employed.



### [Pit Fighting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#PitFighting)

Good set of rules for DnD. Conversion should be obvious at this point.



### [Profficency Training](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#Training)

Just read Xgte



### [Scribing a Spell Scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#ScribingaSpellScroll)

Here the DnD and HARN rules are very different—one involves time plus money the other requires time + component and spell rolls. Since I treat scrolls as Harn minor artifacts that have the "store" common magic—I let players choose which system they'd rather use here (cause I play a fusion of two game systems).



### [Selling (or buying) a Magic Item](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#SellingMagicItems)

Selling magic items is more heavily dependent on the active setting. When I play lower fantasy settings this comes down to good haggling and investigation. High fantasy I typically ditch the rules and just set prices based on power, utiliity, and rarity with no DTP involved.



### Skill Point Conversion: TBD

I've worked with the idea of converting DTP to Skill specific points to modify a single result or buy out skill checks or items. I think I need to rework this a bit before I'm happy commiting to its rules.



### [Sowing Rumors](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#SowingRumors)

Sowing Rumors I've never used. Conversion is obvious. Might be fun to play with



### Spell Practice

Spell practice in a sanctuary streamlined to the number of level up rolls per hour / day (in DTP) based on *safe* cast time of given spells (balancing any cost to spell casting). 



### Spell Research

Spell research is already straight forward. Put in time (DTP days), record modifiers, make roll, record result. Roll consequences if necessary. 



### [Training to Gain Levels (or boons)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#TrainingtoGainLevels)

I've never been a fan of this on a pure time + money = XP computation. I do however like to allow players to unlock features and boons unrelated to XP level through training. I think this comes down to a negotiation between the character and DM. What do you want? How do you plan to get it? Ok here's what it'll cost in time and money.
Honestly... all down time activities are that kind of a bargaining process—just some are more defined...



### Tactics Planning

Tactics planning is time spent understanding deployments, formation, and organization of a given organization, army, or criminal syndicate. Provides **Tactical Points** dealing with the general group but not individuals of the group I.e. command an engagement, sneak past a patrol, etc. **Tactical Points** are like campaigning Influence points but with a distinct difference: tactical points consumed will modify any check, save, to hit, or damage rolls by one in your favor for the **duration of a game session or mission (DM's discretion)**. 

>   The fluff here is akin to one member of the party having studied before planning a major bank heist. Planning for how the bank's security operates the individual accumulates five tactical points. 
>
>   Having five tactical points going into the heist. The heist may run over the course of a couple sessions but will involve stealth checks, possible combat encounters, or non-lethal takedowns (incapacitate an enemy to avoid encounter).
>
>    In this case the bank's security is the target, its Challenge Rating may be something like a 5, 8, 13, or 21 (risk / reward). Spending a few days worth of DTP  to accumulate tactical points the individual then buffs the entire party for the duration of that heist, giving a +1 modifier for each tactical point spent for ALL checks against bank security. 
>
>   Once the mission is over those bonuses are gone. The can be assumed to modify its tactics so the old tricks wont work anymore. This is one of those cases where good roleplaying may award benefits during play but a player who wants to spend the down time who maybe less confident in roleplaying can get that extra assurance that this heist will go smoother. 



## Awarding Down Time Points: When and How Much?

>   Remember the goal of DTP is to let players advance their own goal and preparedness without breaking the flow of the party's combined story. Be generous with DTP or restrictive based on the campaign style. 
>   DTP will increase the power or resources a character has.
>   DTP will change how characters think what they can attain between sessions.
>   Restrict DTP when necessary to avoid having to re-ballance encounters. 
>   Be generous with DTP when charaters aren't on a time crunch—especially as a reward for completing an adventure.

This definitely comes down to DM style but I have settled on a few key times to award DTP.

1.   At the end of each game day I like to give each player at least 1 DTP to add to their bucket.
     I think I like to say a short rest awards 0-1 DTP. A long rest awards 1-2. 
2.   At the end of any major encounters where the characters would need a break. Only massochists go from fighting the fire giants to immeditely rushing into combat with an army of ogres. The challenge rating of an encounter usually deterimines both Experience Points and Down Time Points I award. If I'm extremely lazy I just make it a formula, like DTP = CR/4 or something. 
     After boss encounters characters are probably going to take a longer break if they can—give them DTP equal to a couple days. 
     Campaign level threats think about weeks or months of DTP, then they can throw some writing into their personal projects and come to the next session (especially if there's a hiatus) with fresh ideas.
3.   At the end of a session I like to toss out additional free DTP so players have a chance to think of what they want to have their characters accomplish between sessions. Here I like to be generous and give them a couple days worth of DTP, especially on sessions that end with a long rest—that way characters can have a brief respite of personal development without breaking up the adventure.

When getting into late game where characters start having vassles, thriving buisnesses, or loyal retainers—consider using DTP be passively generated by NPC's who are loyal or respect them. Incentivise players to build the world by giving them down time as the NPC's that respect them start carrying their burdens or doing tasks for them.
