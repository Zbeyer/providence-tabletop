## Down Time Planning: A Currency for Everything

Characters wanted time apart from the party. Certain rule systems, game settings, or story progressions encouraged this. Characters desired down time at varied intervals. Settings like HARN—for example—forced personal progression goals and development to vary wildly from character to character. For some, a single day for shopping was all one wanted before adventure, for others there was never enough down time to satisfy personal projects. Knights wanted a week to train. Mages needed a month to research a new spell. Artificers played a constant balancing act: they hoarded wealth to spend on artisians and attempted spell rituals during item creation. A third of all HARN setting is dedicated to character recovery or preperation between adventures.

The DnD 5e book, " [**XANATHAR'S GUIDE TO EVERYTHING**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte)," attempted to work activities with rollable events. Initially I sought to increase the range and scale of these events. I used a D20 and treated higher rolls with greater rewards and a natural 1 would create some kind of loss. Players tried it. They liked it. But never spent a full game week to, "carouse," even knowing they could get one of several feats (toughness, tavern brawler, etc.) on a good role. It just didn't work for our party.

The problem I ran into, across multiple campaigns and parties, was ultimately coordination, especially in urban campaigns. Players enjoyed the veriety of urban settings. Characters went off on their own while I tried to maintain story   cohesion. It was rough. I increased the number of pickpocket encounters to keep low and high perception characters together. I tried various shopping experiences to balance time, story, and events. Some players wanted to do too much independent roleplay. Others performed a lot of routine actions which felt automated. A month of sessions I just juggled diverging actions. Some players always felt they weren't getting the screen time they wanted.

Stories continued to drift further apart. It became impossible to manage. The noble Ranger wanted to hunt his family's murderers. The identiy crisis changling Thief wanted to become the head of the underworld crime syndicate and bring in reforms. The corrupted Warlock/Paladin wanted to spread his new denomination and earn boons from his fiendish patron. The simple Goliath barbareon wanted to start a chicken farm and squish goblins. Their stories were filled with twists and turns. Events would overlap: the chicken merchant was running an underground cock-fighting ring for the thieves Guild. The Ranger infiltrated the underground and found the conspirators who killed his family. That vindicated the Rouge who insisted reforms to the underworld was needed. These were all satisfying overlaps in the story—but some characters were always left out. The dwarf mage just mined rocks in the basement. For three sessions. 

HARN's magic research system made the problem worse: players wanted to devote entire game months to spell research. I speculated better ways to handle prolonged down time—one where players could still make all the individual progression they desired but still bring the main sessions back to the group. 

The solution I came to was a currency. A currency for everything.
