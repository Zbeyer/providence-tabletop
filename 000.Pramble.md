## Preamble: I Run Open Ended Games

I have run freeform tabletop role playing games for nearly two decades. I am guilty of virtually every anti-pattern in the tabletop gaming community. Some games felt like a an endurance slog. Some became an ever ambitious escallation into absurdismâ€”characters increased in powers to surpass deities. Some just wanted to be farm sims. In spite of my many failings as a Game Master, players continue to allow me to run games for them. So I continue to do it. 

All my games are open ended. I have always abhorred the feeling of being on rails. Tabletop role playing games provide a level of flexibility, agency, and freedom that doesn't exist in the vast world of pure literature, choose your own adventure, or video games. If the party didn't challenge *Saron*, the Dark Lord just continued to be a growing presence in the world. If they did not want to take the ring to Mordor, no one would force them. Player characters made the decisions. Where to go. How to act. What to do. If they left the filled in part of the map, I wrote new 

I never wrote campaigns. I wrote characters. Who were the non-player actors? What were their guiding philosophies? What did they want? What would they bargain for? On what would they compromise? Or be intransigent towad? They made moves even without no player engagement. They struck make deals with each other. They created drama and conflict on their own. 

Player characters that entered the world chose how to involve themselves. Player characters got the details they wanted. Had influence based on their actions. If players investigated, asked questions, and practiced intrigue they learned motivations, hooks, and how to play the NPCs to their advantage. Players content at mercinary roles took an endless stream of content from a chosen NPC and saw that NPC's influence grow through their actions. Players that sought to give quests made stories of their own. Stories that couldn't be found in any module.

But what about what about when the players disagree on how to spend their agency or want to venture down different paths?
